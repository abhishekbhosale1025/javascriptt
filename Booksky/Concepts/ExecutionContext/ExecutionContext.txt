Everything in js happes inside an Execution Context

It has two components and 
    > Memory component/Variable Environmnet : All the variables and fucntions are store 
    > Code component/Thread of execution : Where the whole code execuded line by line 

Two phases of globle execution context
    > Memory allocation phase allocateds Memory for     
        - variables its undefine
        - function it copies whole function
    > Code execution phase : the JS code executed line by line 
        - for fucntion invocation it again created the execution context

Call stack/Execution conetext stack/Program stack/Control stack/Runtime stack/Machine stack :
             The whole execution context is pushed inside it , like the globle one first 
             then the following onces once the code is execute it pops out of the stack
             - Call stack maintains the order of execution conetext

> JS is a synchronouus single threaded lang
